              <strong className="text-clever-navy">Vercel eve</strong> — an agent
              framework that handles the hard parts so the assistant can focus on good
              answers. eve is why it can hold the thread of a conversation across
              follow-ups and survive restarts (durable sessions), pause to ask a human
              and resume later (human-in-the-loop), call retrieval as a tool, re-crawl
              the help center on a schedule, and expose that same retrieval brain over
              MCP so it works inside your editor too. One framework, one knowledge base,
              one voice — wherever you meet it.
